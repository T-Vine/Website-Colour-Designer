# Website-Colour-Designer
An in-production website for testing different backgrounds, text colours, etcetera.

##Capabilities
- Linear Gradients
- Radial Gradients
- Developer Tools: more complex inputs designed for developers: e.g. all hex text-colours.
- Simple tools: common colours and inputs for the normal user.

##For Users:
To use, simply enter the website, and use the searches or specific colours. Background and Text Colours Expect 1 input. Linear Gradients and Radial Gradients expect 2 colours, comma-seperated: e.g. 'blue,red' for a gradient with blue in the centre, turning to red.

Developer Inputs expect a full entry of what is expected within a CSS File, e.g. the contents of 'radial-gradient()'. This allows more functionality and a greater variety of gradients, but is harder to use.

##For Developers:
